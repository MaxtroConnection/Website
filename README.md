# Website
This repository will be used to update and manage the design and code of Maxtro Connection's website.

Maxtro Connection will be a student driven 'social network' and will have an emphasis on social media instead of sharing to friends what you had for lunch.

The php, sql and ajax will obviously be edited privately as publicly displaying it would be stupid (security side)

Our main team of developers are teenagers so if you see a primitive mistake - sorry.

Thank you for taking the time to read that.
